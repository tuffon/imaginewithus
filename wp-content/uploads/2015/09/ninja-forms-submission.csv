This charming book follows Goo as he goes through life at a snailâ€™s pace. He has to; he is a snail, after all. But when Goo sees some of his best friends jumping, flying and swinging, he wants to learn to go as fast as they do. It's kind of like MacGyver meets Evel Kneivel - but in the bug world. And at the end of it all, Goo learns that doing things at your own speed definitely has its advantages.
