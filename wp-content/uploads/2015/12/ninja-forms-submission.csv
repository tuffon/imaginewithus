She dreams of becoming a princess, but when she tells her friends at school, they do not understand how someone who wears a headscarf could also wear a crown. More than anything, The Story of Princess Hijab reminds us that self-acceptance is necessary if our dreams are to become a reality.","$5","mschwa18@lion.lmu.edu","checked"
